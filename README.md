# Big Data HPC 

This repository contains the material corresponding to the webinar/Hands-on: _Using PySpark_. The objectives are:

1. **Present** quickly and objectively concepts of Code Portability and Optimization;
2. **Show** through simple examples the use of Parallel and Distributed Programming in multiprocessor systems;
3. **Expose** students to applicability in case studies.

Material available in \*.ipynb (Jupyter NoteBook) format. There are 2 notebooks in this repository:

## [1-original.ipynb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GBkahxtgPEWyZNyC9eXnG9EsZN83ZYSY/view?usp=sharing)
The introductory notebook contains original application without optimizations.

## [2-otimizacao.ipynb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FiwyRiXWWrc_JaiiM5lGKkzKaHE2nVyw/view?usp=sharing)
This noteBook shows a case study of an application that will apply the optimizations techniques in the original code.
